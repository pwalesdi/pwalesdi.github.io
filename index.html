    <p>This is my first paragraph on my website. I will write about things that I like and enjoy here. There are so many intereting things. I am going to put my favorite Harry Potter quotes:
    <br>
  <ul>
    <li><i>“Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>"Time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead."</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more."</i></li>
    <br>

    <li><i>“It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.”</i></li>
  </ul>
    </p>
